## Testing & Verification

To verify your installation is working correctly, see our testing guides:

- **[VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md)** - Quick reference card (30 seconds - 5 minutes)
- **[TESTING.md](TESTING.md)** - Comprehensive testing guide (detailed)

**Quick Check (30 seconds):**
```bash
npm start
# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
# Look for green "Backend Connected" indicator ✅
```

**Command-Line Check:**
```bash
# Start server
npm start

# Test backend
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok",...}
```
